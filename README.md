FLICKSCORE

Flickscore is a web application written in the Flask web framework for Python. It allows users to search for movies and view their average rating. The average rating is obtained from both the critic and user ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, and Metacritic. All information comes from the OMDB API. The user interface was created using Bootstrap.
